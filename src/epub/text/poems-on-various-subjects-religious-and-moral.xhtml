			<h2 epub:type="title">To Maecenas</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Maecenas, you, beneath the myrtle shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Read o’er what poets sung, and shepherds play’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What felt those poets but you feel the same?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not your soul possess the sacred flame?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their noble strains your equal genius shares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In softer language, and diviner airs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">While Homer paints, lo! circumfus’d in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Celestial Gods in mortal forms appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift as they move hear each recess rebound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heav’n quakes, earth trembles, and the shores resound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great Sire of verse, before my mortal eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lightnings blaze across the vaulted skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as the thunder shakes the heav’nly plains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A deep felt horror thrills through all my veins.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When gentler strains demand thy graceful song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The length’ning line moves languishing along.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When great Patroclus courts Achilles’ aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The grateful tribute of my tears is paid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prone on the shore he feels the pangs of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stern Pelides tend’rest passions move.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Great Maro’s strain in heav’nly numbers flows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Nine inspire, and all the bosom glows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O could I rival thine and Virgil’s page,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or claim the Muses with the Mantuan Sage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon the same beauties should my mind adorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the same ardors in my soul should burn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then should my song in bolder notes arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all my numbers pleasingly surprise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But here I sit, and mourn a grov’ling mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fain would mount, and ride upon the wind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Not you, my friend, these plaintive strains become,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not you, whose bosom is the Muses home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they from tow’ring Helicon retire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fan in you the bright immortal fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I less happy, cannot raise the song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fault’ring music dies upon my tongue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">The happier Terence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> all the choir inspir’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His soul replenish’d, and his bosom fir’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But say, ye Muses, why this partial grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one alone of Afric’s sable race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From age to age transmitting thus his name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the first glory in the rolls of fame?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Thy virtues, great Maecenas! shall be sung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In praise of him, from whom those virtues sprung:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While blooming wreaths around thy temples spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll snatch a laurel from thine honour’d head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While you indulgent smile upon the deed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">As long as Thames in streams majestic flows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Naiads in their oozy beds repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While Phoebus reigns above the starry train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While bright Aurora purples o’er the main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long, great Sir, the muse thy praise shall sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long thy praise shall make Parnassus ring:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then grant, Maecenas, thy paternal rays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear me propitious, and defend my lays.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Grim monarch! see, depriv’d of vital breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A young physician in the dust of death:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou go on incessant to destroy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our griefs to double, and lay waste our joy?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enough thou never yet wast known to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though millions die, the vassals of thy sway:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor youth, nor science, not the ties of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ought on earth thy flinty heart can move.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The friend, the spouse from his dire dart to save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In vain we ask the sovereign of the grave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair mourner, there see thy lov’d Leonard laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er him spread the deep impervious shade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clos’d are his eyes, and heavy fetters keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His senses bound in never-waking sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till time shall cease, till many a starry world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall fall from heav’n, in dire confusion hurl’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till nature in her final wreck shall lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And her last groan shall rend the azure sky:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not, not till then his active soul shall claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His body, a divine immortal frame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">But see the softly-stealing tears apace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pursue each other down the mourner’s face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But cease thy tears, bid ev’ry sigh depart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cast the load of anguish from thine heart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the cold shell of his great soul arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And look beyond, thou native of the skies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There fix thy view, where fleeter than the wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy Leonard mounts, and leaves the earth behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thyself prepare to pass the vale of night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To join for ever on the hills of light:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thine embrace this joyful spirit moves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thee, the partner of his earthly loves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He welcomes thee to pleasures more refin’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And better suited to th’ immortal mind.</span>

				<span>Ye martial pow’rs, and all ye tuneful nine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inspire my song, and aid my high design.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dreadful scenes and toils of war I write,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ardent warriors, and the fields of fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You best remember, and you best can sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The acts of heroes to the vocal string:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resume the lays with which your sacred lyre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did then the poet and the sage inspire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Now front to front the armies were display’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here Israel rang’d, and there the foes array’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hosts on two opposing mountains stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thick as the foliage of the waving wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between them an extensive valley lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er which the gleaming armour pour’d the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When from the camp of the Philistine foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dreadful to view, a mighty warrior rose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dire deeds of bleeding battle skill’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The monster stalks the terror of the field.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Gath he sprung, Goliath was his name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of fierce deportment, and gigantic frame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A brazen helmet on his head was plac’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A coat of mail his form terrific grac’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The greaves his legs, the targe his shoulders prest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dreadful in arms high-tow’ring o’er the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A spear he proudly wav’d, whose iron head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strange to relate, six hundred shekels weigh’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He strode along, and shook the ample field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While Phoebus blaz’d refulgent on his shield:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through Jacob’s race a chilling horror ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thus the huge, enormous chief began:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">“Say, what the cause that in this proud array</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“You set your battle in the face of day?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“One hero find in all your vaunting train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then see who loses, and who wins the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For he who wins, in triumph may demand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Perpetual service from the vanquish’d land:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your armies I defy, your force despise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“By far inferior in Philistia’s eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Produce a man, and let us try the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Decide the contest, and the victor’s right.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Thus challeng’d he: all Israel stood amaz’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ev’ry chief in consternation gaz’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Jesse’s son in youthful bloom appears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And warlike courage far beyond his years:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He left the folds, he left the flow’ry meads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soft recesses of the sylvan shades.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now Israel’s monarch, and his troops arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With peals of shouts ascending to the skies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Elah’s vale the scene of combat lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">When the fair morning blush’d with orient red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What David’s fire enjoin’d the son obey’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swift of foot towards the trench he came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where glow’d each bosom with the martial flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He leaves his carriage to another’s care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And runs to greet his brethren of the war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While yet they spake the giant-chief arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Repeats the challenge, and insults his foes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck with the sound, and trembling at the view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Affrighted Israel from its post withdrew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Observe ye this tremendous foe, they cry’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who in proud vaunts our armies hath defy’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whoever lays him prostrate on the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Freedom in Israel for his house shall gain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And on him wealth unknown the king will pour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And give his royal daughter for his dow’r.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Then Jesse’s youngest hope: “My brethren say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What shall be done for him who takes away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Reproach from Jacob, who destroys the chief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And puts a period to his country’s grief.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“He vaunts the honours of his arms abroad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And scorns the armies of the living God.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Thus spoke the youth, th’ attentive people ey’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wond’rous hero, and again reply’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Such the rewards our monarch will bestow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“On him who conquers, and destroys his foe.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Eliab heard, and kindled into ire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear his shepherd-brother thus inquire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus begun: “What errand brought thee? say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who keeps thy flock? or does it go astray?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I know the base ambition of thine heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But back in safety from the field depart.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Eliab thus to Jesse’s youngest heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Express’d his wrath in accents most severe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When to his brother mildly he reply’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What have I done? or what the cause to chide?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">The words were told before the king, who sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the young hero to his royal tent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the monarch dauntless he began,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For this Philistine fail no heart of man:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I’ll take the vale, and with the giant fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I dread not all his boasts, nor all his might.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thus the king: “Dar’st thou a stripling go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And venture combat with so great a foe?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who all his days has been inur’d to fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And made its deeds his study and delight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Battles and bloodshed brought the monster forth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And clouds and whirlwinds usher’d in his birth.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When David thus: “I kept the fleecy care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And out there rush’d a lion and a bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A tender lamb the hungry lion took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And with no other weapon than my crook</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Bold I pursu’d, and chas’d him o’er the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The prey deliver’d, and the felon kill’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“As thus the lion and the bear I slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“So shall Goliath fall, and all his crew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The God, who sav’d me from these beasts of prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“By me this monster in the dust shall lay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So David spoke. The wond’ring king reply’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Go thou with heav’n and victory on thy side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This coat of mail, this sword gird on,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And plac’d a mighty helmet on his head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The coat, the sword, the helm he laid aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor chose to venture with those arms untry’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then took his staff, and to the neighb’ring brook</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instant he ran, and thence five pebbles took.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mean time descended to Philistia’s son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A radiant cherub, and he thus begun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Goliath, well thou know’st thou hast defy’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yon Hebrew armies, and their God deny’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Rebellious wretch! audacious worm! forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nor tempt the vengeance of their God too far:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Them, who with his omnipotence contend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No eye shall pity, and no arm defend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Proud as thou art, in short liv’d glory great,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I come to tell thee thine approaching fate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Regard my words. The judge of all the gods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Beneath whose steps the tow’ring mountain nods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Will give thine armies to the savage brood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That cut the liquid air, or range the wood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thee too a well-aim’d pebble shall destroy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And thou shalt perish by a beardless boy:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Such is the mandate from the realms above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And should I try the vengeance to remove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Myself a rebel to my king would prove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Goliath say, shall grace to him be shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who dares heav’ns Monarch, and insults his throne?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">“Your words are lost on me,” the giant cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While fear and wrath contended in his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thus the messenger from heav’n replies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Provoke no more Jehovah’s awful hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To hurl its vengeance on thy guilty land:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“He grasps the thunder, and, he wings the storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Servants their sov’reign’s orders to perform.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">The angel spoke, and turn’d his eyes away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adding new radiance to the rising day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Now David comes: the fatal stones demand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His left, the staff engag’d his better hand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The giant mov’d, and from his tow’ring height</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Survey’d the stripling, and disdain’d the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus began: “Am I a dog with thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Bring’st thou no armour, but a staff to me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The gods on thee their vollied curses pour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And beasts and birds of prey thy flesh devour.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">David undaunted thus, “Thy spear and shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Shall no protection to thy body yield:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Jehovah’s name⁠—no other arms I bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I ask no other in this glorious war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To-day the Lord of Hosts to me will give</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Vict’ry, to-day thy doom thou shalt receive;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The fate you threaten shall your own become,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And beasts shall be your animated tomb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That all the earth’s inhabitants may know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That there’s a God, who governs all below:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This great assembly too shall witness stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That needs nor sword, nor spear, th’ Almighty’s hand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The battle his, the conquest he bestows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And to our pow’r consigns our hated foes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Thus David spoke; Goliath heard and came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To meet the hero in the field of fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah! fatal meeting to thy troops and thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou wast deaf to the divine decree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young David meets thee, meets thee not in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis thine to perish on th’ ensanguin’d plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">And now the youth the forceful pebble flung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Philistia trembled as it whizz’d along:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his dread forehead, where the helmet ends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just o’er the brows the well-aim’d stone descends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It pierc’d the skull, and shatter’d all the brain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prone on his face he tumbled to the plain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goliath’s fall no smaller terror yields</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than riving thunders in aerial fields:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The soul still ling’red in its lov’d abode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till conq’ring David o’er the giant strode:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goliath’s sword then laid its master dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the body hew’d the ghastly head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blood in gushing torrents drench’d the plains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The soul found passage through the spouting veins.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">And now aloud th’ illustrious victor said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Where are your boastings now your champion’s dead?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce had he spoke, when the Philistines fled:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But fled in vain; the conqu’ror swift pursu’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What scenes of slaughter! and what seas of blood!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There Saul thy thousands grasp’d th’ impurpled sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In pangs of death the conquest of thine hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And David there were thy ten thousands laid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus Israel’s damsels musically play’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Near Gath and Edron many an hero lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breath’d out their souls, and curs’d the light of day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their fury, quench’d by death, no longer burns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And David with Goliath’s head returns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Salem brought, but in his tent he plac’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The load of armour which the giant grac’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His monarch saw him coming from the war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus demanded of the son of Ner.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Say, who is this amazing youth?” he cry’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thus the leader of the host reply’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“As lives thy soul I know not whence he sprung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“So great in prowess though in years so young:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Inquire whose son is he,” the sov’reign said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Before whose conq’ring arm Philistia fled.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the king behold the stripling stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goliath’s head depending from his hand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To him the king: “Say of what martial line</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Art thou, young hero, and what sire was thine?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He humbly thus; “The son of Jesse I:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I came the glories of the field to try.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Small is my tribe, but valiant in the fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Small is my city, but thy royal right.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then take the promis’d gifts,” the monarch cry’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conferring riches and the royal bride:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Knit to my soul for ever thou remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“With me, nor quit my regal roof again.”</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Enlarg’d he sees unnumber’d systems roll,</span>

				<span>Beneath him sees the universal whole,</span>

				<span>Planets on planets run their destin’d round,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Hail, happy day, when, smiling like the morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair Freedom rose New-England to adorn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The northern clime beneath her genial ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dartmouth, congratulates thy blissful sway:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elate with hope her race no longer mourns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each soul expands, each grateful bosom burns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While in thine hand with pleasure we behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The silken reins, and Freedom’s charms unfold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long lost to realms beneath the northern skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She shines supreme, while hated faction dies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon as appear’d the Goddess long desir’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sick at the view, she languish’d and expir’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus from the splendors of the morning light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The owl in sadness seeks the caves of night.</span>
			</p>

				<span class="i1">No more, America, in mournful strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wrongs, and grievance unredress’d complain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No longer shalt thou dread the iron chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which wanton Tyranny with lawless hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had made, and with it meant t’ enslave the land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Should you, my lord, while you peruse my song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence flow these wishes for the common good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By feeling hearts alone best understood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was snatch’d from Afric’s fancy’d happy seat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What pangs excruciating must molest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What sorrows labour in my parent’s breast?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steel’d was that soul and by no misery mov’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from a father seiz’d his babe belov’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such, such my case. And can I then but pray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Others may never feel tyrannic sway?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">For favours past, great Sir, our thanks are due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thee we ask thy favours to renew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since in thy pow’r, as in thy will before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sooth the griefs, which thou did’st once deplore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May heav’nly grace the sacred sanction give</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all thy works, and thou for ever live</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not only on the wings of fleeting Fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though praise immortal crowns the patriot’s name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to conduct to heav’ns refulgent fane,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>A Town involv’d in grief bereft of thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy Lucy sees thee mingle with the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rends the graceful tresses from her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild in her woe, with grief unknown opprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sigh follows sigh deep heaving from her breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Too quickly fled, ah! whither art thou gone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah! lost for ever to thy wife and son!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hapless child, thine only hope and heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clings round his mother’s neck, and weeps his sorrows there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The loss of thee on Tyler’s soul returns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Boston for her dear physician mourns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">When sickness call’d for Marshall’s healing hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With what compassion did his soul expand?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In him we found the father and the friend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In life how lov’d! how honour’d in his end!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">And must not then our Aesculapius stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring his ling’ring infant into day?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The babe unborn in the dark womb is tost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seems in anguish for its father lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Gone is Apollo from his house of earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But leaves the sweet memorials of his worth:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The common parent, whom we all deplore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From yonder world unseen must come no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet ’midst our woes immortal hopes attend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spouse, the sire, the universal friend.</span>

				<span>My song more happy speaks a greater name,</span>

				<span>The Atheist sure no more can boast aloud</span>

				<span>No more the flow’ry scenes of pleasure rife,</span>

				<span>Nor charming prospects greet the mental eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more with joy we view that lovely face</span>

				<span>Smiling, disportive, flush’d with ev’ry grace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">The tear of sorrow flows from ev’ry eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Groans answer groans, and sighs to sighs reply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What sudden pangs shot thro’ each aching heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, Death, thy messenger dispatch’d his dart?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy dread attendants, all-destroying Pow’r,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurried the infant to his mortal hour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could’st thou unpitying close those radiant eyes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or fail’d his artless beauties to surprise?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not his innocence thy stroke controul,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>But, like a branch that from the tree is torn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls prostrate, wither’d, languid, and forlorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Where flies my James?” ’tis thus I seem to hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The parent ask, “Some angel tell me where</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“He wings his passage thro’ the yielding air?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Methinks a cherub bending from the skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Observes the question, and serene replies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“In heav’ns high palaces your babe appears:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Prepare to meet him, and dismiss your tears.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not th’ intelligence your grief restrain,</span>

				<span>And turn the mournful to the cheerful strain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cease your complaints, suspend each rising sigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cease to accuse the Ruler of the sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Parents, no more indulge the falling tear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let Faith to heav’n’s refulgent domes repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There see your infant, like a seraph glow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What charms celestial in his numbers flow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Melodious, while the foul-enchanting strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwells on his tongue, and fills th’ ethereal plain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enough⁠—for ever cease your murm’ring breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not as a foe, but friend converse with Death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since to the port of happiness unknown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He brought that treasure which you call your own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gift of heav’n intrusted to your hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cheerful resign at the divine command:</span>

				<span>While deep you mourn beneath the cypress-shade</span>

				<span>The hand of Death, and your dear daughter laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In dust, whose absence gives your tears to flow,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Suspend the sigh, dear Sir, and check the groan,</span>

				<span>Divinely bright your daughter’s Virtues shone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How free from scornful pride her gentle mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which ne’er its aid to indigence declin’d!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Expanding free, it sought the means to prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unfailing charity, unbounded love!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">She unreluctant flies to see no more</span>

				<span>Her dear-lov’d parents on earth’s dusky shore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impatient heav’n’s resplendent goal to gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She with swift progress cuts the azure plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where grief subsides, where changes are no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And life’s tumultuous billows cease to roar;</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Thou who did’st first th’ ideal pencil give,</span>

				<span>Inspire with glowing energy of thought,</span>

				<span>The wealthy heir of Tantalus divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He most distinguish’d by Dodonean Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To approach the tables of the gods above:</span>

				<span>And decks the orient realms with rosy light</span>

				<span>What if their charms exceed Aurora’s teint.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No words could tell them, and no pencil paint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy love too vehement hastens to destroy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each blooming maid, and each celestial boy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Now Manto comes, endu’d with mighty skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The past to explore, the future to reveal.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thro’ Thebes’ wide streets Tiresia’s daughter came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divine Latona’s mandate to proclaim:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Theban maids to hear the orders ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thus Maeonia’s prophetess began:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">“Go, Thebans! great Latona’s will obey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And pious tribute at her altars pay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“With rights divine, the goddess be implor’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nor be her sacred offspring unador’d.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus Manto spoke. The Theban maids obey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pious tribute to the goddess pay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rich perfumes ascend in waving spires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And altars blaze with consecrated fires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fair assembly moves with graceful air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leaves of laurel bind the flowing hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Niobe comes with all her royal race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With charms unnumber’d, and superior grace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her Phrygian garments of delightful hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inwove with gold, refulgent to the view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond description beautiful she moves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like heav’nly Venus, ’midst her smiles and loves:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She views around the supplicating train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shakes her graceful head with stern disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proudly she turns around her lofty eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus reviles celestial deities:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What madness drives the Theban ladies fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To give their incense to surrounding air?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Say why this new sprung deity preferr’d?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why vainly fancy your petitions heard?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Or say why Caeus’ offspring is obey’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“While to my goddesship no tribute’s paid?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For me no altars blaze with living fires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No bullock bleeds, no frankincense transpires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tho’ Cadmus’ palace, not unknown to fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And Phrygian nations all revere my name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Where’er I turn my eyes vast wealth I find.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo! here an empress with a goddess join’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What, shall a Titaness be deify’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To whom the spacious earth a couch deny’d!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nor heav’n, nor earth, nor sea receiv’d your queen,</span>

				<span>“ ’Till pitying Delos took the wand’rer in.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Round me what a large progeny is spread!</span>

				<span>“What if indignant she decrease my train</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“More than Latona’s number will remain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then hence, ye Theban dames, hence haste away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nor longer off’rings to Latona pay?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Regard the orders of Amphion’s spouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And take the leaves of laurel from your brows.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Niobe spoke. The Theban maids obey’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their brows unbound, and left the rights unpaid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">The angry goddess heard, then silence broke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Cynthus’ summit, and indignant spoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Phoebus! behold, thy mother in disgrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who to no goddess yields the prior place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Except to Juno’s self, who reigns above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The spouse and sister of the thund’ring Jove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Niobe, sprung from Tantalus, inspires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Each Theban bosom with rebellious fires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No reason her imperious temper quells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But all her father in her tongue rebels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wrap her own sons for her blaspheming breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Apollo! wrap them in the shades of death.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Latona ceas’d, and ardent thus replies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The God, whose glory decks th’ expanded skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">“Cease thy complaints, mine be the task assign’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To punish pride, and scourge the rebel mind.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Phoebe join’d.⁠—They wing their instant flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thebes trembled as th’ immortal pow’rs alight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">With clouds incompass’d glorious Phoebus stands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The feather’d vengeance quiv’ring in his hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Near Cadmus’ walls a plain extended lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Thebes’ young princes pass’d in sport the day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the bold coursers bounded o’er the plains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While their great masters held the golden reins.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ismenus first the racing pastime led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rul’d the fury of his flying steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah me,” he sudden cries, with shrieking breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While in his breast he feels the shaft of death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He drops the bridle on his courser’s mane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before his eyes in shadows swims the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, the first-born of great Amphion’s bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was struck the first, first mingled with the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Then didst thou, Sipylus, the language hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of fate portentous whistling in the air:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when th’ impending storm the sailor sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He spreads his canvas to the fav’ring breeze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So to thine horse thou gav’st the golden reins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gav’st him to rush impetuous o’er the plains:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ah! a fatal shaft from Phoebus’ hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smites thro’ thy neck, and sinks thee on the sand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Two other brothers were at wrestling found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in their pastime claspt each other round:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A shaft that instant from Apollo’s hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Transfixt them both, and stretcht them on the sand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together they their cruel fate bemoan’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together languish’d, and together groan’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together too th’ unbodied spirits fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sought the gloomy mansions of the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Alphenor saw, and trembling at the view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beat his torn breast, that chang’d its snowy hue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He flies to raise them in a kind embrace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A brother’s fondness triumphs in his face:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alphenor fails in this fraternal deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dart dispatch’d him (so the fates decreed:)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon as the arrow left the deadly wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His issuing entrails smoak’d upon the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">What woes on blooming Damasichon wait!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His sighs portend his near impending fate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just where the well-made leg begins to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the soft sinews form the supple knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The youth sore wounded by the Delian god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Attempts t’ extract the crime-avenging rod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, whilst he strives the will of fate t’ avert,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divine Apollo sends a second dart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift thro’ his throat the feather’d mischief flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bereft of sense, he drops his head, and dies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Young Ilioneus, the last, directs his pray’r,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cries, “My life, ye gods celestial! spare.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Apollo heard, and pity touch’d his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ah! too late, for he had sent the dart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou too, O Ilioneus, are doom’d to fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fates refuse that arrow to recal.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">On the swift wings of ever flying Fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Cadmus’ palace soon the tidings came:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Niobe heard, and with indignant eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She thus express’d her anger and surprise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why is such privilege to them allow’d?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why thus insulted by the Delian god?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Dwells there such mischief in the pow’rs above?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why sleeps the vengeance of immortal Jove?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now Amphion too, with grief oppress’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had plung’d the deadly dagger in his breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Niobe now, less haughty than before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With lofty head directs her steps no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She, who late told her pedigree divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drove the Thebans from Latona’s shrine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How strangely chang’d!⁠—yet beautiful in woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She weeps, nor weeps unpity’d by the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each pale corse the wretched mother spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay overwhelm’d with grief, and kiss’d her dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then rais’d her arms, and thus, in accents slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Be sated cruel Goddess! with my woe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If I’ve offended, let these streaming eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And let this sev’nfold funeral suffice:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah! take this wretched life you deign’d to save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“With them I too am carried to the grave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Rejoice triumphant, my victorious foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But show the cause from whence your triumphs flow?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tho’ I unhappy mourn these children slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yet greater numbers to my lot remain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She ceas’d, the bow string twang’d with awful sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which struck with terror all th’ assembly round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except the queen, who stood unmov’d alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By her distresses more presumptuous grown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the pale corses stood their sisters fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sable vestures and dishevell’d hair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One, while she draws the fatal shaft away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faints, falls, and sickens at the light of day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sooth her mother, lo! another flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blames the fury of inclement skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, while her words a filial pity show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck dumb⁠—indignant seeks the shades below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now from the fatal place another flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls in her flight, and languishes, and dies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another on her sister drops in death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fifth in trembling terrors yields her breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the sixth seeks some gloomy cave in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck with the rest, and mingled with the slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">One only daughter lives, and she the least;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The queen close clasp’d the daughter to her breast:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye heav’nly pow’rs, ah spare me one,” she cry’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah! spare me one,” the vocal hills reply’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In vain she begs, the Fates her suit deny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her embrace she sees her daughter die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1"><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> “The queen of all her family bereft,</span>

				<br/>

				<span>Still, wond’rous youth! each noble path pursue,</span>

				<span>On deathless glories fix thine ardent view:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still may the painter’s and the poet’s fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To aid thy pencil, and thy verse conspire!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And may the charms of each seraphic theme</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conduct thy footsteps to immortal fame!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High to the blissful wonders of the skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elate thy soul, and raise thy wishful eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice happy, when exalted to survey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That splendid city, crown’d with endless day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose twice six gates on radiant hinges ring:</span>

			<p>
				<span class="i1">Calm and serene thy moments glide along,</span>

				<span>May peace with balmy wings your soul invest!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when these shades of time are chas’d away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And darkness ends in everlasting day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On what seraphic pinions shall we move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And view the landscapes in the realms above?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There shall thy tongue in heav’nly murmurs flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there my muse with heav’nly transport glow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more to tell of Damon’s tender sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or rising radiance of Aurora’s eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For nobler themes demand a nobler strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And purer language on th’ ethereal plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cease, gentle muse! the solemn gloom of night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now seals the fair creation from my sight.</span>

			<p>
				<span>The poet asks, and Phillis can’t refuse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To show th’ obedience of the Infant muse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She knows the Quail of most inviting taste</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fed Israel’s army in the dreary waste;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what’s on Britain’s royal standard borne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the tall, graceful, rampant Unicorn?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Emerald with a vivid verdure glows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the gems which regal crowns compose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boston’s a town, polite and debonair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To which the beaux and beauteous nymphs repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each Helen strikes the mind with sweet surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While living lightning flashes from her eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See young Euphorbus of the Dardan line</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Manelaus’ hand to death resign:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The well known peer of popular applause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is C⁠⸺⁠m zealous to support our laws.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quebec now vanquish’d must obey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She too much annual tribute pay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Britain of immortal fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And add new glory to her name.</span>
